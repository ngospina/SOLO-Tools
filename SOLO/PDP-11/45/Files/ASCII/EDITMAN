A DESTINATION MEDIUM.
  EDITING COMMANDS ARE INPUT FROM THE CONSOLE. THERE ARE ONLY TWO KINDS OF
COMMANDS: DELETE ONE OR MORE LINES, AND COMPLETE THE COPYING OF THE
SOURCE FILE. ANYTHING ELSE INPUT FROM THE CONSOLE IS APPENDED TO THE
DESTINATION FILE AT ITS CURRENT POSITION. INITIALLY, THE DESTINATION FILE
IS EMPTY.
  THE EDITOR IS ONLY ABLE TO DELETE AND INSERT COMPLETE LINES
IDENTIFIED BY LINE NUMBERS.

  THE COMMAND: EDIT(F) IS EQUIVALENT TO: EDIT(F, F).
  THE SOURCE CAN EITHER BE AN ASCII DISK FILE OR A SEQUENTIAL PROGRAM
THAT INPUTS AN ASCII FILE.
  THE DESTINATION FILE CAN BE AN ASCII DISK FILE, A SEQUENTIAL PROGRAM
THAT OUTPUTS AN ASCII FILE, OR A NON-EXISTING FILE. IN THE FIRST CASE,
THE EXISTING FILE (WHICH MUST BE UNPROTECTED) IS REPLACED BY A NEW ONE
OF THE SAME NAME. IN THE LAST CASE, A NEW FILE IS CREATED AND STORED ON DISK.
IN BOTH CASES, THE RESULTING DISK FILE WILL BE AN UNPROTECTED ASCII
FILE.
